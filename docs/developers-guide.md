## Coverage workflow contract

Both coverage lanes set up Python 3.13 with `actions/setup-python` and name it
again with a step-level `UV_PYTHON`, inside the project's `requires-python`
(`>=3.12`). generate-coverage chooses its interpreter from its `python-version`
input, then `UV_PYTHON`, then `.python-version`, then the `python3` on `PATH`,
which is the most recent `setup-python` step before the call in its job;
`uv sync` refuses an interpreter outside `requires-python`.
`tests/workflow_contracts/test_coverage_python_version.py`, with its reader in
`tests/workflow_contracts/coverage_python_sources.py`, requires every
generate-coverage call in the pull-request lane and the publisher to declare at
least one of those sources, every declared source to name the same version,
that version to be inside `requires-python`, and both lanes to measure on that
one version. A `setup-python` step guarded by `if:` or allowed to fail with
`continue-on-error` declares nothing. The ratchet baseline key already carries
the interpreter (`ratchet-baseline-<os>-py<major.minor>-`), so a lane on
another Python would miss its baseline rather than compare against the wrong
one; the contract turns that silent restart into a failure. It uses
`packaging`, a development dependency.
