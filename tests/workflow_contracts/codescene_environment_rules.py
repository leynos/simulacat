"""Hold the CodeScene token's environment to the uploading job (CV-005).

The token lives in the `codescene` environment, whose deployment policy admits
`main` alone. So every job that invokes the uploader declares that
environment, no other job does, and no workflow a pull request can start
declares it in any job: a declaration there would let branch code ask for the
token.

The module composes the existing readers rather than restating them: the
workflows come from `loading.read_workflows`, the uploader is matched exactly
as `codescene_publisher.UPLOAD_ACTION`, and the pull-request surface is
`codescene_reach.pull_request_closure`, which already follows `./` and `$/`
calls and `workflow_run` chains.
